Aight so currently I have completed:

The skeleton of the frontend. All I need is to complete the style.css and iron out bugs on that
end.

The lexer. I must add things but the basic setup has been created using cython. (May replace with
own C code at some point.)

I need to implement the depth of inheritance and class variables.

I must also alter the lexer so that it cuts up the token stream more i.e splitting brackets and
the contents of those brackets.
